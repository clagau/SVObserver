Activating Tracing in SVObserver.txc

Currently, many TRACE() AND ::OutputDebugString() calls in SVObserver projects are disabled by 
	#if defined ()
preprocessor commands.

Failure-related TRACE()s are active because TRACE_FAILURE is defined in SVOGlobalProperties.props

To reactivate all TRACEs(), 
		TRACE_THEM_ALL 
needs to be #defined. 

Traces can also be activated in groups by #defining any or all of the following, as desired:

	TRACE_OTHER

	TRACE_GRIDCTRL
	TRACE_XMLENCRYPT
	TRACE_SVXPARSER
	TRACE_MEMORY
	TRACE_MATROXGIGE
	TRACE_VISUALFX
	TRACE_THREAD
	TRACE_PPQ
	TRACE_SVO
	TRACE_LUT
	TRACE_REGEX
	TRACE_PROFILER
	TRACE_OILIST
	TRACE_IP
	TRACE_ARCHIVE
	TRACE_DESTRUCT
	TRACE_SOCKET
	TRACE_MATROX_FUNCTION
	TRACE_INPUT_VALUES
	TRACE_VALUE_OBJECT
	
If new TRACEs or ::OutputDebugString()s are added please enclose them in 
	#if defined (TRACE_THEM_ALL) || defined (TRACE_<whatever>)
and
	#endif
	
	
TRACE_OTHER is a catchall for several TRACE()s for which no obvious grouping could be found

Feel free to define	new #defines but please enter them in the list above
