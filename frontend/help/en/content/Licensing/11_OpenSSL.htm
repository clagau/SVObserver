        <h5>OpenSSL</h5>
        <p>OpenSSL is covered by one of two licenses, depending on which            release is involved.  In all cases, there is a file named             <code>LICENSE</code> in the top-level of the release.            Copies can also be found here.</p>
        <p>            For the 3.0.0 release, and later releases derived from that,             the Apache License v2            applies.            This also applies to the git "master" branch.             </p>
        <p>            For any release made before OpenSSL 3.0.0 (namely            the 1.1.1, 1.1.0, 1.0.2, and all prior releases including            those not currently supported),	     the dual OpenSSL and SSLeay            license            applies.            Note that this is also true for any updates to those            releases -- the "letter suffix" --  no matter when they are made.            It also applies to the git branches for all those            releases, and to any public forks that have not rebased to            master (or 3.0.0). </p>
