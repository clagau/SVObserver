            <p>This is the official license for the Python 3.4.0 release:</p>
            <p>A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE</p>
            <p>==========================</p>
            <p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting</p>
            <p>Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands</p>
            <p>as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's</p>
            <p>principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.</p>
            <p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for</p>
            <p>National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)</p>
            <p>in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the</p>
            <p>software.</p>
            <p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to</p>
            <p>BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same</p>
            <p>year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope</p>
            <p>Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software</p>
            <p>Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a</p>
            <p>non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related</p>
            <p>Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of</p>
            <p>the PSF.</p>
            <p>All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for</p>
            <p>the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python</p>
            <p>releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes</p>
            <p>the various releases.</p>

            <p>Footnotes:</p>
            <p>(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under</p>
            <p>the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute</p>
            <p>a modified version without making your changes open source.  The</p>
            <p>GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with</p>
            <p>other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.</p>
            <p>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,</p>
            <p>because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to</p>
            <p>CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1</p>
            <p>is "not incompatible" with the GPL.</p>
            <p>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's</p>
            <p>direction to make these releases possible.</p>
