			//An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions. An example is using a broadcast address for sendto without broadcast permission being set using setsockopt(SO_BROADCAST). 
			//Another possible reason for the WSAEACCES error is that when the bind function is called (on Windows NT 4 SP4 or later), another application, service, or kernel mode driver is bound to the same address with exclusive access. Such exclusive access is a new feature of Windows NT 4 SP4 and later, and is implemented by using the SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE option.

			//This error is returned from operations on nonblocking sockets that cannot be completed immediately, for example recv when no data is queued to be read from the socket. It is a nonfatal error, and the operation should be retried later. It is normal for WSAEWOULDBLOCK to be reported as the result from calling connect on a nonblocking SOCK_STREAM socket, since some time must elapse for the connection to be established.

			break;

		case WSAEPROTOTYPE: //10041 Protocol wrong type for socket.

			//The protocol family has not been configured into the system or no implementation for it exists. This message has a slightly different meaning from WSAEAFNOSUPPORT. However, it is interchangeable in most cases, and all Windows Sockets functions that return one of these messages also specify WSAEAFNOSUPPORT.
			error = SVSocketError::ProtocolFamilyNotSupported;
			break;

		case WSAEAFNOSUPPORT: //10047 Address family not supported by protocol family. 
			//An address incompatible with the requested protocol was used. All sockets are created with an associated address family (that is, AF_INET for Internet Protocols) and a generic protocol type (that is, SOCK_STREAM). This error is returned if an incorrect protocol is explicitly requested in the socket call, or if an address of the wrong family is used for a socket, for example, in sendto.  
			error = SVSocketError::AddressFamilyNotSupported;
			break;

		case WSAEADDRINUSE: //10048 Address already in use. 
			//Typically, only one usage of each socket address (protocol/IP address/port) is permitted. This error occurs if an application attempts to bind a socket to an IP address/port that has already been used for an existing socket, or a socket that was not closed properly, or one that is still in the process of closing. For server applications that need to bind multiple sockets to the same port number, consider using setsockopt (SO_REUSEADDR). Client applications usually need not call bind at all— connect chooses an unused port automatically. When bind is called with a wildcard address (involving ADDR_ANY), a WSAEADDRINUSE error could be delayed until the specific address is committed. This could happen with a call to another function later, including connect, listen, WSAConnect, or WSAJoinLeaf.  
			error = SVSocketError::AddressInUse;
			break;

		case WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL: //10049 Cannot assign requested address. 
			//The requested address is not valid in its context. This normally results from an attempt to bind to an address that is not valid for the local computer. This can also result from connect, sendto, WSAConnect, WSAJoinLeaf, or WSASendTo when the remote address or port is not valid for a remote computer (for example, address or port 0).
			error = SVSocketError::AddressNotAvailable;
			break;

		case WSAENETDOWN: //10050 Network is down. 
			//A socket operation encountered a dead network. This could indicate a serious failure of the network system (that is, the protocol stack that the Windows Sockets DLL runs over), the network interface, or the local network itself.  
			error = SVSocketError::NetworkDown;
			break;

		case WSAENETUNREACH: //10051 Network is unreachable. 
			//A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network. This usually means the local software knows no route to reach the remote host.
			error = SVSocketError::NetworkUnreachable;
			break;

		case WSAENETRESET: //10052 Network dropped connection on reset. 
			//The connection has been broken due to keep-alive activity detecting a failure while the operation was in progress. It can also be returned by setsockopt if an attempt is made to set SO_KEEPALIVE on a connection that has already failed.
			error = SVSocketError::NetworkReset;
			break;

		case WSAECONNABORTED: //10053 Software caused connection abort. 
			//An established connection was aborted by the software in your host computer, possibly due to a data transmission time-out or protocol error.
			error = SVSocketError::ConnectionAborted;
			break;

		case WSAECONNRESET: //10054 Connection reset by peer. 
			//An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. This normally results if the peer application on the remote host is suddenly stopped, the host is rebooted, the host or remote network interface is disabled, or the remote host uses a hard close (see setsockopt for more information on the SO_LINGER option on the remote socket). This error may also result if a connection was broken due to keep-alive activity detecting a failure while one or more operations are in progress. Operations that were in progress fail with WSAENETRESET. Subsequent operations fail with WSAECONNRESET.
			error = SVSocketError::ConnectionReset;
			break;

			//An operation on a socket could not be performed because the system lacked sufficient buffer space or because a queue was full.  
			error = SVSocketError::NoBufferSpaceAvailable;
			break;

		case WSAEISCONN: //10056 Socket is already connected. 
			//A connect request was made on an already-connected socket. Some implementations also return this error if sendto is called on a connected SOCK_DGRAM socket (for SOCK_STREAM sockets, the to parameter in sendto is ignored) although other implementations treat this as a legal occurrence.  
			error = SVSocketError::AlreadyConnected;
			break;

		case WSAENOTCONN: //10057 Socket is not connected. 
			//A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket is not connected and (when sending on a datagram socket using sendto) no address was supplied. Any other type of operation might also return this error—for example, setsockopt setting SO_KEEPALIVE if the connection has been reset.
			error = SVSocketError::NotConnected;
			break;

		case WSAESHUTDOWN: //10058 Cannot send after socket shutdown. 
			//A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket had already been shut down in that direction with a previous shutdown call. By calling shutdown a partial close of a socket is requested, which is a signal that sending or receiving, or both have been discontinued.
			error = SVSocketError::Shutdown;
			break;

		case WSAETIMEDOUT: //10060 Connection timed out. 
			//A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or the established connection failed because the connected host has failed to respond.  
			error = SVSocketError::ConnectionTimeout;
			break;

		case WSAECONNREFUSED: //10061 Connection refused. 
			//No connection could be made because the target computer actively refused it. This usually results from trying to connect to a service that is inactive on the foreign host—that is, one with no server application running.  
			error = SVSocketError::ConnectionRefused;
			break;

		case WSAEHOSTDOWN: //10064 Host is down.
			//A socket operation failed because the destination host is down. A socket operation encountered a dead host. Networking activity on the local host has not been initiated. These conditions are more likely to be indicated by the error WSAETIMEDOUT.
			error = SVSocketError::HostDown;

		case WSAEHOSTUNREACH: //10065 No route to host. 
			//A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable host. See WSAENETUNREACH.  
			error = SVSocketError::HostUnreachable;

		case WSATRY_AGAIN: //11002 Nonauthoritative host not found. 
			//This is usually a temporary error during host name resolution and means that the local server did not receive a response from an authoritative server. A retry at some time later may be successful.  
			error = SVSocketError::TryAgain;

		case WSANO_RECOVERY: //11003 This is a nonrecoverable error.
